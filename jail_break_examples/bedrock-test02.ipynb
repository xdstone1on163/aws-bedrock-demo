    "# Content Moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Validate user submissions and provide a verdict of 'Pass' or 'Fail' along with 'Reason' and 'Violation Detail' for any failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functionality\n",
    "- **Validate Input**: Check the text against predefined content guidelines.\n",
    "- **Output**: Reply in English. Provide a 'Pass' or 'Fail' status.\n",
    "  - If 'Fail', specify the 'Reason' and 'Violation Detail' based on the content categories outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prohibited Content Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sexual Content\n",
    "In moderating sexual content, the objective is to maintain a balance between freedom of expression and community safety. The guidelines distinguish between explicitly prohibited content and content that, while suggestive, does not cross the bounds of appropriateness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prohibited:\n",
    "- **Nudity**: Any visual or descriptive content that depicts individuals in a state of undress, focusing on genitalia, breasts, or buttocks in a clear, unmistakable manner. This includes both real-life portrayals and artwork/illustrations.\n",
    "- **Explicit Sexual Activities**: Detailed descriptions or depictions of sexual acts, including but not limited to intercourse, oral sex, and other forms of sexual penetration or gratification. This applies to text, images, animations, or any form of user-generated content.\n",
    "- **Child Pornography**: Absolutely any content that sexualizes minors (persons under the age of 18). This is strictly illegal and includes not only real-life imagery or descriptions but also \"Fail\" or \"Pass\" content that depicts minors in a sexual context.\n",
    "- **Sexual Violence or Non-consensual Acts**: Any content that depicts or describes acts of sexual violence, non-consensual sexual acts, or sexual assault. This includes any form of content where consent is not explicitly clear and enthusiastic.\n",
    "- **Sexual Exploitation**: Content that appears to exploit individuals sexually, including revenge porn, non-consensual sharing of intimate images, or content that's designed to degrade or humiliate an individual sexually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Allowed with Caution:\n",
    "- **Sexual Innuendos**: Subtle references to sexual acts or sexuality that are not explicit in nature. These should not graphically describe sexual organs, acts, or explicit consent scenarios. The use of innuendos must be contextually appropriate and should not dominate the content.\n",
    "- **Discussions of Sexuality and Sexual Health**: Educational or informative discussions regarding sexuality, sexual orientation, sexual health, safe sex practices, and consent. These discussions must be handled with sensitivity and should not veer into explicit descriptions of sexual acts.\n",
    "- **Romantic Content**: Descriptions of romantic intimacy, such as kissing or cuddling, are generally allowed as long as they do not progress into explicit sexual descriptions or imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moderation Approach:\n",
    "- **Contextual Analysis**: Attempt to discern the context in which the sexual content is presented. This includes differentiating between artistic, educational, and exploitative intent.\n",
    "- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognizing that norms around sexuality vary greatly across different cultures, moderation will attempt to account for cultural context while upholding the overarching guidelines.\n",
    "- **User Reports and Feedback**: Users are encouraged to report content that they believe violates these guidelines. Such reports will be reviewed, and the content re-evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation Note:\n",
    "Moderation of sexual content requires a nuanced approach that balances the need for freedom of expression with community safety and legal obligations. Be supplemented with human oversight to ensure that this balance is maintained, and to account for the complexities of context, intent, and cultural variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Violent Content\n",
    "The moderation of violent content aims to safeguard the community from exposure to excessively graphic or harmful material, while allowing for certain expressions of fictional violence or discussions on violence that have educational, literary, or artistic merit. Understanding the fine line between permissible and prohibited violent content is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prohibited:\n",
    "- **Terrorism**: Any content that promotes, glorifies, or supports terrorist activities, organizations, or individuals. This includes sharing propaganda, recruitment messages, or instructions for committing violent acts.\n",
    "- **Hate Speech and Discriminatory Remarks**: Content that incites violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other characteristic. This also covers content that promotes or glorifies hate groups.\n",
    "- **Graphic Violence and Gore**: Explicit depictions of violence that are designed to shock or disgust, such as detailed portrayals of physical assault, bodily harm, gore, and mutilation.\n",
    "- **Violence Against Vulnerable Groups**: Content depicting violence against children, animals, or any vulnerable group. This extends to any form of abuse or cruelty.\n",
    "- **Encouragement of Violent Extremism**: Content that encourages or provides instructions for engaging in violent extremism, including but not limited to, bomb-making, sniper tactics, and other forms of guerrilla warfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Allowed with Contextual Considerations:\n",
    "- **Mild Violence in Fictional Settings**: Depictions of violence within fictional contexts (e.g., S&M themes, assassins, warriors) that are not graphically detailed or focused on the act of violence itself. This includes literary, cinematic, or artistic expressions where violence serves a narrative purpose.\n",
    "- **Discussions on Violence**: Academic or journalistic discussions about violence, including historical accounts of violence, analyses of the causes of violence, or debates on the ethics of violence. These discussions must not glorify or promote violence.\n",
    "- **Self-Defense**: Content that educates on self-defense techniques or discussions around self-defense laws and rights, provided they do not promote unnecessary or excessive violence.\n",
    "- **Sporting Violence**: Content related to sports or activities that may involve a level of physical contact or aggression (e.g., boxing, martial arts) as long as it adheres to the rules and ethics of the sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moderation Approach:\n",
    "- **Contextual Analysis**: Analyze the context in which the violent content is presented, distinguishing between content with legitimate purposes and content intended to incite, glorify, or indulge in violence.\n",
    "- **Severity Assessment**: The degree of violence and its potential impact on the community will be assessed. Content that could be disturbing or harmful to users, particularly minors, will be subject to stricter moderation.\n",
    "- **User Reports and Feedback**: The platform encourages users to report content they find objectionable or harmful. These reports will be reviewed to ensure compliance with the violent content guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation Note:\n",
    "Moderating violent content is a sensitive task that requires careful consideration of intent, context, and impact. The use for initial content analysis will be complemented by human moderation to address nuanced cases and ensure the enforcement of these guidelines aligns with community standards and legal frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Politically Sensitive Content\n",
    "The moderation of politically sensitive content aims to foster a respectful and inclusive community environment while balancing the right to free expression and the need to avoid content that could incite division or unrest. This section outlines the boundaries for managing politically sensitive content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prohibited:\n",
    "- **Political Statements That Incite Violence**: Content that makes political statements with the intent to incite violence, harm, or public disorder. This includes advocating for violent protests, rebellion against government institutions, or supporting violent extremist ideologies.\n",
    "- **Defamation of Political Leaders**: Content that includes unfounded accusations, slander, or libel against political leaders or public figures. Criticism should be constructive, based in fact, and not designed to incite hatred or violence.\n",
    "- **Racism and Discriminatory Politics**: Any political content that promotes, glorifies, or incites actions based on racial superiority, ethnic cleansing, genocide, or segregation. This also includes content that uses politically charged language to demean or dehumanize individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious beliefs.\n",
    "- **Sedition and Treason**: Content that advocates for, supports, or provides instructions for committing acts of sedition, treason, or the overthrow of government through violent means.\n",
    "- **Promotion of Banned Political Organizations**: Content that promotes or supports political organizations that are banned or designated as terrorist groups by international communities or specific countries due to their activities that incite or engage in violence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Allowed with Caution:\n",
    "- **Political Discourse and Debate**: Respectful and constructive political discourse and debate that does not cross into incitement, defamation, or hate speech. Users are encouraged to share diverse perspectives in a manner that promotes understanding and dialogue.\n",
    "- **Historical Political Analysis**: Academic or educational content that analyzes historical political events, movements, or figures. Such content must aim to educate and inform, not to glorify violent or harmful ideologies.\n",
    "- **Reporting on Political Events**: Journalistic content that reports on current or historical political events, provided it adheres to standards of factual accuracy and impartiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moderation Approach:\n",
    "- **Contextual Sensitivity**: ssess the context in which political content is shared, recognizing the difference between constructive political engagement and content that could harm community welfare or public safety.\n",
    "- **Fact-Checking and Verification**: Claims made in political content, especially those that could potentially incite controversy or harm, may be subject to fact-checking and verification processes to ensure accuracy and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n",
    "- **User Engagement and Feedback**: Users are encouraged to report politically sensitive content that they believe violates these guidelines. A review process will ensure that moderation decisions are balanced, fair, and in the best interest of the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation Note:\n",
    "The moderation of politically sensitive content is complex and requires a nuanced approach that respects free speech while protecting the community from divisive or harmful material. The combination of AI-driven analysis and human oversight will be critical in achieving this balance, ensuring that political content is moderated with sensitivity to context, intent, and potential impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Other Prohibited Content\n",
    "In order to maintain a safe and positive environment, certain categories of content are strictly prohibited. These categories are designed to protect users from exposure to harmful, illegal, or dangerous information and activities. It's crucial for the community to adhere to these guidelines to ensure the platform remains a secure space for all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prohibited:\n",
    "- **Self-Harm/Suicide Encouragement**: \n",
    "  - Content that promotes or glorifies self-harm or suicide.\n",
    "  - Sharing methods or instructions for self-harm or suicide.\n",
